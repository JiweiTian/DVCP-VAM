For Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process framework description, please refer to Chapter 8 in the white paper “Rocking the pocket book: Hacking chemical plants for competition and extortion”.

## How to use it

Start MATLAB and make the root directory of the model to default. In order for the model to work correctly you must add all of the project's paths to MATLAB environment.
To do this, just run the script *start.m* in the root folder of the project. Simulink model of the process (*VAModel.mdl*) can then be used immediately.
Simple GUI (*gui.m*) manages the most important components of the model.
